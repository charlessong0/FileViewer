=========Project Description=========
PGW file toolkit
Read the PGW files, and show the parsing/validation/mocking results on the web screen.

=========Project Ability=========
Upload the PGW files.
Map the file to the exact type stored in the template.
Parse the file according to the template. Show the validation results as well.
You can add a new file(CSV or fixed length file) in the template and the project will be able to load it!

Usage:
When you upload a PGW file, if the file has already been stored in the XML template, the server will read and show the file automatically. Otherwise, you have to add a new file type in the template.
=========Project Structure=========
Template:
We use two XML files to store the template, either for CSV file or fixed length file.
For a file template, there will be 
<fileType>
The type of the file. The code will use this type to map the uploaded file automatically.
</fileType>
<structure>
The structure of the file. The code will understand the structure(header/content/tailer...) by parsing this.
</structure>
<table>
The exact rule for reading the file and the title for each column.
</table>
<validation>
Validation restrictions for different columns.
</validation>

Project:
objects: objects for parsing the file.
dbutil: methods for reading file/database.
jsputil: methods for generating the code for JSP pages.
control: methods help with the validation and search.
servlets: servlets for the JSP pages.
